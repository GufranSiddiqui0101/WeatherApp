## WeatherApp

WeatherApp is a web application that provides users with real-time weather information for locations around the world. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this application fetches weather data from a weather API and displays it in a user-friendly interface.

### Features:

- **Current Weather:** Display the current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and description.
- **Location Search:** Allow users to search for weather information by city name or ZIP code.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensure compatibility across various devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

### Technologies Used:

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **API:** Utilize a weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap API) to fetch weather data.
- **AJAX:** Use AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) for making asynchronous requests to the weather API.
- **JSON Parsing:** Parse the JSON response from the API to extract relevant weather information.

### How to Use:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Obtain an API key from a weather API provider (e.g., OpenWeatherMap).
3. Replace the placeholder API key in the JavaScript code with your actual API key.
4. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
5. Enter a city name or ZIP code in the search field and press Enter to retrieve weather information for that location.
6. View the current weather conditions and other relevant data displayed on the screen.
